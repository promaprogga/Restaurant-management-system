the time and capacity. After going to the restaurant, the customer is able 
to select foods from the online menu of the corresponding restaurant. 
Either the customer can serve himself/herself or the waiter can bring the 
food to the specic table. For the later case, an extra charge will be 
added. The bill will be generated accordingly, and payment can be made 
online through the system.
The system has a panel where the admins can add/delete restaurants, 
update/create/delete menus, handle orders, and generate reports.
